check TODOs wherever they are

model: remove hparams from __init__ -> no hparams awarenes
strategy full implementation
run_backtest to properly create optimizer and backtest
hp_optimizer to implement optim + backtest

add pyportfolio opt and stock selection
- move hp optimizer to top of workflow (to manage hps of model, strategy and MLflow logging)
- research notebook to identify scope and write only relevant code
- run backtest

- genai
verify tests for models
verify autogen workflow

LLM prompt
"
rewrite the optuna optimization so that the workflow becomes:
from: run_backtest -> strategy -> optuna hp optimizer -> model 
to:    run_backtest -> optuna hp optimizer -> strategy -> model

moreover the optuna hp optimizer should handle all the hparams for both model and strategy, as well as full mlflow logging (meaning, you should move all the mlflow logging from strategy and model directly to the hp_optimizer). Provide minimal code changes and output, add comments when necessary. Make it production ready. After writing the code, review it and fix any mistakes. Then only when it's ready provide the changes.
